/// The two message-buffer shapes a `Shared<T>` can hold.
///
/// - **Bounded**: a fixed-capacity [`BoundedMpmcQueue`] (Vyukov's
///   lock-free ring-buffer algorithm) — genuinely lock-free push/pop, no
///   mutex anywhere on the hot path. This replaced an earlier
///   `Mutex<VecDeque<T>>` that measured multiple times slower than
///   `tokio::sync::mpsc` under contention (`benches/sync_performance.rs`'s
///   `mpsc_multi_producer_throughput`) — the mutex itself, not just the
///   waiter bookkeeping, was the bottleneck.
/// - **Unbounded**: a [`MpmcStack`] (the same lock-free Treiber stack
///   used elsewhere in this crate). A stack alone is LIFO, which would
///   silently reorder messages — wrong for a channel. `try_pop` restores
///   FIFO order the same way [`MpmcStack::drain_all`] already does
///   internally (reverse the LIFO pop order): the *single* receiver (this
///   type isn't `Clone`) keeps a small local `VecDeque` refilled by
///   draining+reversing the whole stack whenever it runs dry, so ordering
///   is exactly as if every message had gone through one shared FIFO,
///   amortized to O(1) per message with zero contention on the drain
///   itself (one atomic pointer swap, not a per-message lock). A bounded
///   ring can't be reused here because "unbounded" means capacity isn't
///   fixed at construction time.
